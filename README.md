# MyAss - Toy x86_64 Assembler

This is just a toy x86_64 'assembler' I'm building for learning purposes. The reason I started this project, beyond my curiosity about how this like this works, is to use it for futures projects, like a JIT compiler.

For now, it supports a few instructions:

- ADD
- IDIV
- IMUL
- MOV
- SUB
- RET
- XOR

Those instructions only can operate on registers and immediate values
